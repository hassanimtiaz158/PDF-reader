## âœ… Overview
This project is a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot powered by Groqâ€™s LLaMA3 models and deployed on Hugging Face Spaces using Gradio. It allows users to upload documents, ask questions based on them, and get smart, contextual answers.

- Redesigned UI with clearer layout and user-friendly controls.
- Added support for:
  - Multiple chunk slider & auto-limit
  - Chat history tracking
  - Markdown-rendered answers
  - Token limit handler (prevents overload)
  - Dark/Light mode toggle
- Smarter model selection panel with icons.

## ðŸ§  Challenges Faced
- Token limit errors from Groq API (`413 Error`) due to large context size.
- Handling asynchronous file uploads in Gradio.
- Styling with limited CSS customization in Gradio.
- Optimizing chunk size vs token limit for smooth performance.
